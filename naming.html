    <h2><em>CSS naming conventions and organization :</em></h2>
    <p>
        CSS naming conventions and organization are essential for creating maintainable and 
        scalable CSS code. They help to make the code more understandable, reduce code duplication, and improve collaboration between team members. Here are some of the commonly 
        used CSS naming conventions and organization techniques:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>BEM (Block Element Modifier) - BEM is a naming convention that uses a class naming system to define blocks, elements, and modifiers in CSS. 
            It helps to create reusable and maintainable code by providing a clear structure and hierarchy.
        </li>
        <li>
            SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) - SMACSS is a set of guidelines for organizing and managing CSS code. 
            It emphasizes on the separation of
            concerns by dividing styles into base, layout, module, state, and theme. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Atomic CSS - Atomic CSS is a naming convention that uses atomic classes to define specific CSS properties. 
            It helps to create reusable and modular code by providing a 
            limited set of classes that can be combined to create any style.
        </li>
        <li>
            OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS) - OOCSS is a methodology that emphasizes on creating reusable and modular CSS code by separating structure and skin. 
            It uses objects to represent reusable and independent components in CSS.
        </li>
        <li>
            TCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) - ITCSS is a methodology that organizes CSS code based on specificity and inheritance. It defines styles in a hierarchical order from global to local, 
            making it easier to manage and maintain large CSS codebases
        </li>
        <li>
            SMIT (Single-Responsibility Media-Independent CSS) - SMIT is a naming convention that separates CSS code based on device-independent properties and media-specific properties. 
            It helps to create flexible and scalable CSS code that can adapt to different devices and media types.
        </li>
